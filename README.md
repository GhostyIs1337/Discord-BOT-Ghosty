# Discord BOT Ghosty

Discord bot written in C#, with a lot of funcionalities.

## Getting started

This is one of my first "major" projects regarding coding. The whole bot is written in C# and uses some wrappers, and some pure JSON converted to C# classes for API calls. The prefix for the commands is a dot (.), but you can change that in the Program.cs file.

### Bot commands:
- help : Shows every command that is available, .help *SomeCommand* showcases help for that specific command.
- join/play/leave/queue/etc : The bot plays YouTube and other Internet videos while inside of a voice chat.
- pubg (-m) : Displays a users PUBG IDs/stats (account, matches).
- battlefield : Displays a users Battlefield 1 stats.
- csgo : Displays a users CSGO stats.
- pick : The bot will choose one item, between the items you type in. Split them with |.
- faceit (-l ; -id ; -m) : Displays a users FACEIT stats. Lifetime, one match, etc.
- register : Registeres a guest.
- say : Repeats what you typed in.
- vanityurl : Returns the SteamID64 of the user.
- steam : Returns basic steam profile information.
- playerbans : Returns Community, VAC, and economy ban statuses for given players.
- steamprofile : Returns the URL to the steam profile of the user.
- twitch : **TODO**
